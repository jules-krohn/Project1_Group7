Based on our data we were unable to prove the null hypothesis false. 

Trout Data: 
The P value is 2.0093484348496326e-10. From this value, since p <0.5, we reject the null hypothesis and can assume that the difference between samples is not random.  

Walleye Data:
The P value is 9.417384121123249e-07. Based on this value, since p<0.05 we reject the null hypothesis.
